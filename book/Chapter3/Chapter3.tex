\chapter{Real Components}

Components in an Electronics 101 textbook behave very simply and predictably. In the real world, they do so only under a certain set of operating conditions. Fundamental physical properties in their construction make them behave differently in real systems. These non-ideal behaviors are called parasitic effects. This chapter will briefly describe the parasitic effects of passive components.
